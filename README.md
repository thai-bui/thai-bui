This is my little corner of GitHub where I’m documenting my journey as a (soon) data analyst: projects I will be building, experiments I will be trying, and the things I’m learning along the way.

I like to break messy things until they make sense, then ask “why” a dozen more times just to be sure. Numbers are cool, but the real fun is turning them into stories people actually care about.
